README
================

This is the repository for the `ordbetareg` package, which can be used
to fit the ordered beta regression model as specified in Kubinec (2022)
(see paper <https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sx6y/>). This package
will soon be on CRAN, but to use the current version, use this install
command (requires the `remotes` package to be installed first):

    remotes::install_github("saudiwin/ordbetareg_pack",build_vignettes=TRUE,dependencies = TRUE)

You can read about the package in the introduction vignette by using the
`vignette("package_introduction", package="ordbetareg")` command at the
R console.
